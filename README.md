# CiviCRM: ARS Tweaks

This is a custom CiviCRM extension with very specific features. If you're not already
using this extension, it may have no real value for you.

## Functionality

The following functions are provided by this extension:
- if the [Certificates](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/certificates) extension
  is enabled:
  - On the CiviCRM Contact Dashboard, in the Membership section, for all current-status
    memberships (if the user has permissions to print membership Certificates for the
    given contact) add a button labled "Download membership card" which links to the 
    Certificates URL to create a PDF membership card for that membership.


## Configuration
This extension calls for no configuration. However, configurations and permissions for
the Certificates extension are relevant.
